Heat and Mass Transfer of Dew-Point Evaporative Cooling with Macro-Roughened Structure
* Spring 2022: Research Assistant at Chongqing University (Supervised by Prof. Sibao Wang)
  * Reviewed and identified gaps in analyzing the heat and mass transfer mechanisms of cooling performance improvement by macro-roughness at high air velocities (3.5–5.5 m/s) in dew-point evaporative cooling.
  * Derived a turbulent heat and humidity transfer CFD model based on the Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) method, which is the first attempt in dew-point evaporative cooling.
    * Overcame the limitations of conventional thermodynamic models in capturing the interactions between turbulent flow fields and evaporative heat and mass transfer.
    * Developed coupled multi-physics simulation in COMSOL Multiphysics based on the model and designed a rib-roughened channel as a case study to analyze the mechanisms in-depth.
  * Proposed and fabricated a testing platform to test the rib-roughened cooler’s performance on various operating conditions, which is an application of my accumulated manufacturing experience.
  * Achieved outstanding cooling performance and analyzed the variations of governing dimensionless numbers, along with the relationship with turbulent flow fields
    * Accomplished a product air temperature 3 °C lower than that of a flat cooler at a high air velocity of 5.5 m/s.
    * Performed excellent cooling performance with temperature reduction and dew-point effectiveness ranging from 9–14 ℃ and 0.53–0.86, respectively.
    * Improved Nusselt (convective heat transfer rate) and Sherwood (convective mass transfer rate) numbers by 4 and 1.14 times than that of flat ones, respectively.
  * Drafted a research paper based on the findings and submitted for publication. Contributed to conceptualization, investigation, methodology, simulation, data curation, writing of the final manuscript.

Manufacturing of Counter-flow Dew-Point Evaporative Air Conditioners
* Fall 2021: Research Assistant at Chongqing University (Supervised by Prof. Sibao Wang)
* Simulated the flat cooling channels under varying operating conditions through the COMSOL-MATLAB LiveLink interface, and optimized structure parameters of the channels based on extracted results.
* Designed a dew-point evaporative air conditioner model consists of two normal flat plate coolers with 50 pairs of optimized channels, two water tanks, and ducts using UG 12.0.
* Completed the assembly of the conditioner prototype by procuring coolers’ materials, cloud platform data transmission components, and large-diameter axial fans.
* Built the team's first evaporative air conditioner prototype and filed air-conditioner design patents.
* Succeeded in reducing the indoor temperature of a 20 m2 warehouse with a height of 3.6 m from 35 ℃ to 23.2 ℃ in Chongqing Cloud Data Center using the prototype, achieving a coefficient of performance (COP) of 6.25.
* Facilitated the training of students in National Student Innovation Projects.

Development of a novel tube-type Counter-flow Dew-Point Evaporative Cooling Model    
* Spring 2021: Research Assistant at Chongqing University (Supervised by Prof. Sibao Wang)
* Simulated and analyzed the minor effect of the wall gap for insert wick material in tubes on heat loss, and investigated the impact of tube dimensions on cooling effect.
* Proposed a cluster tube cooler model with novel simple tubes, created drawings using AutoCAD, procured raw materials, and assisted to assemble.
* Improved the cooling effect with a 2 ℃ colder product air temperature at a low air velocity of 2 m/s.
* Drafted a research paper and submitted for publication. Contribute to investigation, methodology, and simulation.
