Contributions
======
*	Reviewed and identified gaps in heat and mass transfer analysis of dew-point evaporative cooling performance improvement by macro-roughness at high air velocities (3.5â€“5.5 m/s).
*	Derived a turbulent heat and humidity transfer CFD model, which is the first attempt in this field.
*	Developed coupled multi-physics simulation in COMSOL Multiphysics and designed a rib-roughened channel as a case study to analyze the heat and mass transfer mechanisms in-depth.
*	Fabricated a rib-roughened cooler incorporated with a testing platform to explore performance experimentally, which is an application of my accumulated manufacturing experience.
*	Accomplished an extra 37% temperature reduction than normal flat cooler at 5.5 m/s.
*	Improved Nusselt (convective heat transfer rate) and Sherwood (convective mass transfer rate) numbers by 4 and 1.14 times than that of normal flat ones, respectively.
*	Drafted a research paper based on the findings and submitted for publication. Contributed to conceptualization, investigation, methodology, simulation, data curation, writing of the final manuscript.
