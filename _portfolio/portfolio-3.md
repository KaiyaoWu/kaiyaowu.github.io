Contributions
======
*	Developed a thermodynamic model for the tube-type dew-point evaporative cooler.
*	Simulated and analyzed the minor effect of the wall gap for insert wick material in tubes on heat loss, and investigated the impact of tube dimensions on cooling effect.
*	Proposed a cluster tube cooler model with novel simple tubes, created drawings using AutoCAD, procured raw materials, and assisted to assemble.
*	Improved the cooling effect with a 2 â„ƒ colder product air temperature at a low air velocity of 2 m/s.
*	Drafted a research paper and submitted for publication. Contribute to investigation, methodology, and simulation.
