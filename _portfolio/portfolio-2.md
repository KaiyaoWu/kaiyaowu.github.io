Contributions
======
*	Simulated the flat cooling channels under varying conditions through the COMSOL-MATLAB LiveLink interface, and optimized structure parameters of the channels based on extracted results.
*	Designed an air conditioner prototype model consists of two optimized flat plate coolers using UG 12.0.
*	Assembled the conditioner prototype by procuring coolers’ materials, cloud platform data transmission components, and large-diameter axial fans.
*	Built the team's first evaporative air conditioner prototype and filed air-conditioner design patents.
*	Reduced the indoor temperature of a 20 m2 warehouse with a height of 3.6 m from 35 ℃ to 23.2 ℃ in Chongqing Data Center using the prototype, achieving a coefficient of performance (COP) of 6.25.
*	Facilitated the training of students in National Student Innovation Projects.
