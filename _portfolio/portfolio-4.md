Contributions
======
* Accomplished the preparation of the modified flexible phase change material, tested and verified the synergistic enhancement of the binary fillers on its thermal conductivity, with a maximum of 91.8%.
* Verified the excellent thermal stability even after 100 thermal cycles.
* Demonstrated the outstanding temperature reduce capacity of the flexible composite phase change material under different discharge rate in COMSOL Multiphysics.
* Drafted a research paper and submitted for publication. Currently developing a complete thermal management system that combines bionic liquid cooling channels.
